# Timelines as Gantt chart via matplotlib in Python

## Problem addressed

Gantt charts help keep you realistic about your planning.
They are valuable for planning large, complex projects and managing multiple projects.
However, finding open-source software to make timelines is a pain.
The placeholder plan below is not realistic, but you get the idea.

## Instructions
 1. Edit the path to your Python binary.
 2. Install missing modules with pip.
 3. Relabel the projects in the named tuple to customize.
 4. Edit the start and end dates of each phase of a project in the named tuple to suit.
 5. Add or remove categories of phases if desired.
 7. Change the colors to suit.
 8. Edit the title to suit.
 9. Run `chmod +x 2025writing.py`.
 10. Run the script: `./2025writing.py`.
 11. The resulting image will be displayed and written to a PNG file.

You can repurpose this chart for a single project.
Change the labels to distinct activity names so the time spans appear at different positions along the y-axis.
